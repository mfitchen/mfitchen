          <h1>About Marty Fitchen</h1>
          <p>Hey there! My name is Marty... Fitchen (just like "kitchen" with an F), and I am a dad, husband, younger brother, and son... I am also a creative. Creative work is my professional passion. Whether I am doing the design work myself or managing the design process of others, it brings me so much joy to be a part of revitalizing creative work.</p><p>A rarity these days in Portland, Oregon, I am also southeast PDX born and bred. I love Portland! The trees, the rain, the food, the bridges, the air... it has shaped me in ways that I am still discovering today. More than anything, Portland has influenced my creativity. This city is beautiful... and if you ask me, it's beautifully designed. Sure, out-of-towners might get turned around by a few funky roads but Burnside splits the city North | South and the river divides the city East | West. Simple. Smart.</p><p>I aim to approach any creative project in this way. And there's nothing like bringing that one idea to fruition. It fuels the drive to create something special. My life has groomed me to be a leader and a team-player. I have been captain of a State-winning soccer team, graphics editor and editor-in-chief of the highest-producing high school newspaper in Oregon, led incoming college students in outdoor activities at Passages (the University of Puget Sound [UPS] outdoor orientation program), and choreographed hip-hop and breakdance routines with the largest student-run organization at UPS (Repertory Dance Group).</p><p>Leading various teams helped me dive into the professional world. I have been doing freelance design work since 2007 and have joined a bunch of marketing teams since 2006. I thought I could represent my life's resume visually... after all, I love creativity. So my hope is that you will have a clearer picture of my life and the type of person I am today with the help of my timeline infographic.</p>
